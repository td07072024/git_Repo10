Saint Martin Island (Bengali: সেন্টমার্টিন দ্বীপ, romanized: Senṭmarṭin dip) is a small island (area only 3 km2) in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, about 9 km south of the tip of the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf peninsula, and forming the southernmost part of Bangladesh. There is a small adjoining island that is separated at high tide, called Chera Dwip. It is about 8 kilometres (5 miles) west of the northwest coast of Myanmar, at the mouth of the Naf River.

History and description
Millennia ago, the island used to be an extension of the Teknaf peninsula, but portion of this peninsula later got submerged and thus the southernmost part of the peninsula became an island and was disconnected from the Bangladesh mainland. The island was first settled in the 18th century by Arabian merchants, who named it "Jazira". During British occupation the island was named after the then Deputy Commissioner of Chittagong Mr. Martin as St. Martin Island.[3] Local names of the island are "Narikel Jinjira"[4] which means "Coconut Island", and "Daruchini Dwip" which means "Cinnamon Island". It is the only coral island in Bangladesh.
